A JavaScript Breakdown

written by John Joseph Pietrangelo III
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository holds a book I am writing on the OOP language, JavaScript.

One can cut-and-paste the code in this repository's .js file into their IDE of choice
(I wrote this book using JetBrain's Web-Storm, which is a free IDE for students*** ) 
to debug (walk step by step through the processing of the operations) 
all code held within, while reading the explanation on what is taking place, simultaneously.

I used a popular book on the subject titled 'Eloquent JavaScript', as the template for my book, 'A JavaScript Breakdown'.

A JavaScript Breakdown, is an interactive book, which aims to allow a novice, to the subject-matter of computer programming, 
the ability to follow along, while decreasing the difficulty of understanding the concepts and operations of the application(code) examples.

I named the variables in a way which will help one follow along and I commented every line of code, 
to allow for a higher level of comprehension by the reader.

Many operation returns are written to the console-window, to view their output.

All lines of code returning output to the console-window, have a comment following them with that same output.

This is a work in progress.  I hope this helps someone.  I have put allot of time and effort into it.
