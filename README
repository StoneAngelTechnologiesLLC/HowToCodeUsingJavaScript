A JavaScript Breakdown

This repository holds a book I am writing, on the subject of JavaScript, an OOP(Object Oriented Programing) language. 

(I wrote this book using JetBrain's Web-Storm, which is a free IDE for students*** ) 
Use an IDE to debug (walk step by step through the processing of the operations) 
all code held within, while reading the explanation on what is taking place, simultaneously.

One can cut-and-paste the code in this repository's .js file into their IDE of choice
(I wrote this book using JetBrain's Web-Storm, which is a free IDE for students*** ) 
to debug (walk step by step through the processing of the operations) 
all code held within, while reading the explanation on what is taking place, simultaneously.

I used a popular book on the subject titled 'Eloquent JavaScript', as the template for my book, 'A JavaScript Breakdown'.

A JavaScript Breakdown, is an interactive book, which aims to allow a reader of the subject-matter, 
the ability to follow along with the lessons, while decreasing the difficulty of understanding the concepts and operations of the application(code) examples.

I named the variables in a way which will help one follow along(including data-types to all var names) and I commented above every line of code, 
to allow for a higher level of comprehension by the reader.

Many operation returns are written to the console-window, to view their output.

All lines of code returning output to the console-window, have a comment following them with that same output.

This is a work in progress.  I hope this helps someone.  I have put allot of time and effort into it.

Sincerely,
